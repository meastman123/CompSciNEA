				<p>"Discover How To Finally Ease Long-Term Chronic Pain, Recurring Headaches, Reduce Unwanted Stiffness And Release Tension In Tight Muscles, Naturally - Without Any Nasty Side-Effects"</p>
				<p>Importantly recognised today is that Acupuncture, offered at Weyside by therapists can be used to treat a wide range of common health problems and to reduce pain, with National Health guidelines recommending acupuncture for persistent low back pain and also for migraines and tension type headaches too.</p>
				<p>At Weyside, we are pleased to consider Acupuncture to be used in combination with other physiotherapy treatments such as exercise and manual therapy, which together can significantly enhance your recovery from injury.</p>
				<p>Acupuncture is very safe when carried out by a member of the Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists (AACP) because of the strict hygiene guidelines that must be adhered to, and it is sometimes very reassuring to understand that the needles used by your physiotherapist are individually packaged, sterile and disposed of after use.</p>

			<h2>So, what actually is 'Acupuncture'?</h2>
				<!-- Create paragraph text -->
				<p>Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into the skin.</p>
				<p>It is one of many skills used within physiotherapy as an integrated approach to the management of pain and inflammation, and as a means of stimulating the body's own healing chemicals in order to aid recovery and enhance rehabilitation.</p>
				<p>As hinted at earlier, Acupuncture can be used to treat a wide range of common health problems and to reduce pain. National Health guidelines recommend a course of 10 sessions of acupuncture for persistent low back pain. They have also recognised acupuncture's benefits for migraines and tension-type headaches too.</p>

				<h2>Would you like to know how Acupuncture works?</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>The process of Acupuncture stimulates the body to produce endorphins and oxytocin, which are its own pain and stress-relieving chemicals. It helps to promote sleep by stimulating the release of melatonin in the body and can encourage a sense of well-being by stimulating the release of serotonin. These assist the body's healing processes and offer pain relief as a precursor for other manual or exercise therapy.</p>
					<p>Acupuncture also stimulates nerve fibers to block out pain signals and helps to reduce the sensitivity of tender points in the body.</p>
					<p>Treatment with Acupuncture is undertaken with the aim of restoring all the body systems to a state of balance (homeostasis). There are many systems within the body that require balance in order to achieve health and fitness. This is achieved by an in-depth physiotherapy assessment to determine the source of the imbalance and the correct acupuncture points required to address this imbalance and facilitate the body's return to a state of health both physically and mentally.</p>
					<p>The body has the remarkable ability to "self-repair"; the use of Acupuncture supercharges the repair mechanism and enables an improved recovery time. This allows other physiotherapy treatments such as exercise, muscle strengthening, and rehabilitation to achieve more effective results.</p>
					<p>The acupuncture needle will stimulate the flow of QI [pronounced 'chee'], which circulates in channels or meridians within the body. In the state of a normal healthy body, a balance exists between these systems. If injury, disease, emotional trauma, or infection occurs, the natural flow of QI within the meridians and organs may well be affected, and the result is an altered flow of QI causing pain and inflammation, or a deficit of QI, which may cause weakness, exhaustion, and longer debilitating disease. The stimulation of relevant acupuncture points may free the stagnation and thus help to restore normal QI flow and balance.</p>

				<h2>Often a fear, does Acupuncture hurt?</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>Acupuncture should not be painful. Interestingly, the needles used are the same width as human hair, so having acupuncture does not feel the same as having an injection.</p>
					<p>When needles are inserted, you may feel a temporary, sharp pricking sensation. During the treatment itself, you may have a feeling of warmth or "fullness," heaviness, pins and needles, numbness, tension around the needle, or a mild ache.</p>
					<p>You may also feel a little light-headed or relaxed. It should not feel unpleasant. These are signs that your body is reacting to the acupuncture. Alternatively, you may not feel the needle at all.</p>
					<p>There are several techniques in applying Acupuncture, which we are pleased to describe below:</p>

				<h3>Conventional Acupuncture</h3>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					 <p>Conventional Acupuncture involves the use of single-use, pre-sterilized, disposable needles of varying widths, lengths, and materials that pierce the skin at the Acupuncture points. Our Physiotherapist will determine the locations of the Acupuncture points, based upon the assessment of the cause of the imbalance. A number of needles may be used at each treatment, and these are typically left in position for some 20-30 minutes before being removed.</p>

				<h2>Trigger point Acupuncture</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>Trigger point Acupuncture may also be used to facilitate relaxation in specific muscles following trauma such as whiplash injury; for longer-term unresolved muscle pain such as repetitive strain injury (RSI); or as a means to obtain increased muscle length in order to aid stretch and rehabilitation such as sports injuries. Here the needle is placed into the affected muscle until it is felt to relax under the needle and then removed. Trigger point needling is often much quicker and therefore does not require the 20-30 minute treatment time.</p>

				<h3>Acupressure</h3>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					 <p>Acupressure uses the Physiotherapist's hands over Acupuncture or trigger points in order to relieve muscle tightness or to stimulate QI flow and balance the body. It is a healing art that uses the fingers of the Physiotherapist on the key Acupuncture points. The amount of pressure used varies according to the condition and requires trained, sensitive hands. It is often used with sensitive patients, patients with a needle phobia, children, or frail patients.</p>

				<h2>Evidence for Acupuncture with Knee pain</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>High-quality evidence supports the use of acupuncture to reduce osteoarthritic knee pain, as backed by NHS evidence summaries and SIGN guidelines (2013).</p>
						<p>One study found that acupuncture in an intensive 2–4 week treatment regime resulted in significant pain relief for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (Bjordal et al. 2007).</p>
						<p>A high-quality systematic review found evidence to suggest that acupuncture could be considered one of the most effective physical treatments for alleviating osteoarthritic knee pain (Corbett et al. 2013).</p>

				<h2>Evidence for Acupuncture relieving Neck pain</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>Evidence from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) confirms the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of neck pain. A randomized placebo-controlled trial that assessed the efficacy of traditional acupuncture for chronic neck pain in 190 patients concluded that acupuncture can significantly relieve pain, intensity, and improve the quality of daily life with a long-term clinical effect in patients with chronic neck pain (Liang et al. 2011).</p>
					<p>Physiotherapy aims to promote long-term improvements, and acupuncture can result in pain relief and increased range of movement (ROM). This may allow a patient who would otherwise not be able to fully partake in treatment to engage fully since their pain is less likely to limit them, increasing the likelihood of improved results.</p>
					<p>One systematic review of 14 RCTs confirmed the short-term effectiveness and efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of neck pain (Fu et al. 2009). One treatment session of acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture in improving movement-related neck pain and range of movement in patients with chronic neck pain (Irnich et al. 2002).</p>

				<h2>Evidence for Acupuncture relieving Headaches – it works!</h2>
					<!-- Create paragraph text -->
					<p>The current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (NICE 2012) support the use of acupuncture as a treatment for headaches.</p>
					<p>Acupuncture should be considered as a treatment option for frequent or poorly controlled migraines, especially those experiencing side effects from medication.</p>
					<p>Research suggests that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, medication at treating migraines and has fewer side effects (Linde et al. 2009a).</p>
					<p>A systematic review including 16 RCTs concluded that there was a significant difference between acupuncture and medicine for neurovascular headaches, indicating acupuncture treatment had a superior effect (Zhao et al. 2011).</p>
					<p>Acupuncture could be a valuable non-medicine treatment for patients with frequent or chronic tension-type headache (Linde et al. 2009b).</p>
